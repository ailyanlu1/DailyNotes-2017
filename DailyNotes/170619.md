Have you check these issue?

1.How about Test(-100); ?

2.I see you don’t have “ten” in dict2, have you consider if you need it or not?

3.Name your variable name more readable and understandable.

Like dict1,dict2,dict3 to numLess20Array, severalTensArrary, specialNameArrary, etc.

Like “vector<string> ret;” to “vector<string> numStrArray;”, etc. ret is often use in “return ret;”

4.Left for other members to comment if others found.
