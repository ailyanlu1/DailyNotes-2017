[头文件string与string.h的区别](http://www.cnblogs.com/Cmpl/archive/2012/01/01/2309710.html)

Wiki:

Each header from the C Standard Library is included in the C++ Standard Library under a different name, generated by removing the .h, and
adding a 'c' at the start; for example, 'time.h' becomes 'ctime'. The only difference between these headers and the traditional C Standard
Library headers is that where possible the functions should be placed into the std:: namespace (although few compilers actually do this).
In ISO C, functions in the standard library are allowed to be implemented by macros, which is not allowed by ISO C++.
