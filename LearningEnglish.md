昨日不会重现 No one can call back yesterday.

无风不起浪 No smoke without fire.

旧瓶装新酒 New wine in old bottles.

留得青山在，不怕没柴烧 Where there is life, there is hope.

世上无难事，只怕有心人 Where there is a will, there is a way.

三个臭皮匠胜过诸葛亮 Two heads are better than one.

名利双收 Gain both fame and wealth.

谋事在人，成事在天 Man proposes; God disposes.

一分耕耘，一分收获 No pains,no gains.

事实胜于雄辩 Actions speak louder than words.
