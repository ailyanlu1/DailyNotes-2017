昨日不会重现 No one can call back yesterday.

无风不起浪 No smoke without fire.

旧瓶装新酒 New wine in old bottles.

留得青山在，不怕没柴烧 Where there is life, there is hope.

世上无难事，只怕有心人 Where there is a will, there is a way.

三个臭皮匠胜过诸葛亮 Two heads are better than one.

名利双收 Gain both fame and wealth.

谋事在人，成事在天 Man proposes; God disposes.

一分耕耘，一分收获 No pains,no gains.

事实胜于雄辩 Actions speak louder than words.

事实胜于雄辩 Actions speak louder than words.

三个臭皮匠胜过诸葛亮 Two heads are better than one.

一分耕耘一分收获 No pains, no gains.

旧瓶装新酒 New wine in old bottles.


好事不出门，坏事传千里Bad news travels fast.

一言既出，驷马难追A promise is a promise.

留得青山在，不怕没柴烧 Where there is life, there is hope.

世上无难事，只怕有心人 Where there is a will, there is a way.


名利双收 Gain both fame and wealth.

谋事在人，成事在天 Man proposes; God disposes.

无风不起浪 No smoke without fire.

昨日不会重现 No one can call back yesterday.
