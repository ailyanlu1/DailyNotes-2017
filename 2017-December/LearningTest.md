For Appium, I want to provide an easy way for you to try: Use online emulator: https://appetize.io/docs#appium-overview

Require: Java or node.js on Linux.

Client side is a console application on Linux or Windows: https://github.com/appetizeio/appium-samples , it will post http request to 

remote online emulator to run appium test, you can see the Android/IOS UI on the web browser, it is free.

Appium script is like following in client console application: just run the application on your Linux virtual machine, it will show on 

web browser on website https://appetize.io .
